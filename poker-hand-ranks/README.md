Poker Hand Ranks
================

The Gems deck has different poker hand ratings than you may be used too. That is because the hands have a different probability, since the cards are different and no card can be played high and low. The hands are listed in rank order. Hands of the same rank are compared by their highest card. In the case where there are sets of cards (full house, three of a kind, two pair, etc.), compare the high card of the largest set first. If hands differ only in suit, they tie.

1. **Five of a Kind:** Five cards of the same rank.
2. **Straight Flush:** Five cards of sequential rank in the same suit.
3. **Straight:** Five cards of sequential rank.
4. **Four of a Kind:** Four cards of one rank.
5. **Full House:** Three cards of the one rank, and two cards another rank.
6. **Flush:** Five cards of one suit.
7. **Three of a Kind:** Three cards of one rank.
8. **Two Pair:** Two cards of one rank, and two cards of another rank.
9. **High Card:** None of the above. This includes Pairs, which are more likely than No Pair.
