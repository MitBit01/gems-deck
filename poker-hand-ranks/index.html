  <h1>Gems Deck Poker Hands</h1>
  <p>The Gems deck has different poker hand ratings than you may be used too. That is because the hands have a different
    probability, since the cards are different and no card can be played high and low.</p>
  <h2>List of Hands</h2>
  <p>The hands are listed in rank order. Hands of the same rank are compared by their highest card. In the case where
    there are sets of cards (full house, three of a kind, two pair, etc.), compare the high card of the largest set
    first. If hands differ only in suit, they tie.</p>
  <h2>Calculated Probability</h2>
  <p>The below tables are calculated from <span id="prob-count">4,000,000</span> hands.</p>
  <h3>5-card Poker</h3>
  <p>5-card Poker hands.</p>
  <table id="prob-table-5"></table>

  <table id="prob-table-7"></table>
  <h3>Sicasep</h3>
