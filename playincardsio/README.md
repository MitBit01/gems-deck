[PlayingCards.io](http://playingcards.io) is a website for playing card games online, and it supports custom cards! There are 2 methods to get started:

1. Import room.pcio as the room. This has a deck already setup. This is the easiest method but can't be used to add to an existing room.
2. Import deck.csv as a custom deck. Remove the extra card with both sides the same. Make sure each card is in the deck twice. Set the card height to 144.
