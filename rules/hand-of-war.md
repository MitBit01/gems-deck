Hand of War
===========
A classic 2 player game of reading and attrition by Mitchell Petit.

The card game War traditionally isn't really a game. This is a zany variation that is actually a game.

The objective is to claim all of the cards.

Setup
-----
1. Shuffle the deck.
2. Both player takes half the deck as their Reserves.
3. Both player draws 3 cards into their hand. Both player shows their hand to their opponent, then keeps it hidden for the rest of the game.

Play
----
Play is simultaneous.
1. *Deploy:* Both players play a card facedown in the middle. Players with less than 3 cards in their hand draw up to 3. Players with insufficient Reserves shuffle their Spoils into their Reserves. The player that can't deploy loses.
2. *Battle:* Both players flip their played card. The card with the higher rank wins the battle, and both cards are moved to the winner's Spoils pile.
    - A card of rank 1 wins against a 10.
    - If there is a tie, but not twins, both cards stay in the middle and a new round begins. These cards will be taken by the winner of the next round.
    - If the cards are twins, the top 5 cards of both player's reserves are swapped with each other.
3. *Powers:* If a 2, 3, or 4 was played, their powers are resolved simultaneously.
    - Ruby (*Researcher*): Look at the top 2 cards of your reserves.
    - Emerald (*Engineer*): Draw an extra card.
    - Sapphire (*Spy*): Look at the top card of your opponent's reserves.

Variations
----------
It is trivial to add powers to this game, and the possibilities are endless. However, simplifying this game takes much of it away: it becomes a non-game. Gradually add these variations to remove rules and reduce the game to its original style of play:
1. Powers aren't used. Twins don't result in cards being traded.
2. 1's are treated normally and don't outrank 10's.
3. There is no hand: cards are played directly off the top of the Reserves.
4. The game ends when the Reserves are empty: the player with the most Spoils wins, with draws possible.
