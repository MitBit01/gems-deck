Mitchell's Markdown Style
=========================
I have a style when it comes to writing markdown documents and documents in general. This is not a formal style guide, and doesn't consider what the word "style" really means. You don't even have to use markdown, but whatever you use, try to match the spirit, interpret it in your own way, or be consistent.

All documents are written in CommonMark markdown with the tables extension and sometimes auto-links. The files have a `.md` extension. Lines can extend an arbitrary length; use an editor with wrapping features. Don't use `#` to denote headings when you don't have to. Use an even number of indentations, but only as many as needed.

All documents begin with a Level 1 heading titling the document, followed by a short description (not necessarily a sentence) with the author's name. Afterwards, the rest of the document is organized into sections that start with Level 2 headings. Every heading is followed by some content before any subheadings; every pair of headings is separated by some content. Level 3 headings should rarely be used. Levels beyond 3 should encourage the author to restructure their document.

Hyphens are used too often. Parenthesis are used around fragments that can be omitted by the reader. Double-quotes are used around individual words to when the word itself is the subject. Code blocks are used around most computer-related content, such as file extensions, despite these not being code.

Write in a neutral, third-person, past perspective. Sometimes use the present perspective. Use the conversational tone rarely (referring to "I" and "you"), and isolate it to its own paragraph, where no other perspective is used.

Have fun.
