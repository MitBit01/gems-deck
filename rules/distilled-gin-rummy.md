Distilled Gin Rummy
===================
A classic 2 player game of constructing melds and scoring points by Mitchell Petit.

This is a variation of Gin Rummy, specifically Straight Gin, aimed at simplifying play and scoring. This may actually make it closer to other Rummy games than Gin, but this is hard to tell as there are so many Rummy games.

The objective is to reach 50 points. Each hand, players try to form a hand entirely of melds.

Setup
-----
A means of keeping score is necessary. The game is played as a series of hands where the first dealer is determined randomly.

Play
----
Each hand is begun as follows:
1. The dealer shuffles the deck and deals 10 cards to themselves and 11 to their opponent.
2. The non-dealer finishes their first turn by discarding a card.

Afterwards, the players alternate taking turns, continuing with the dealer. On their turn a player must:
1. Draw a card from either the discard pile or stock.
2. Discard a card.
    - A player cannot discard the same card they drew from the discard pile; this would be a pass.
3. Check for Gin. If their hand consists of only melds, the hand ends.
    - Melds are either Sets of 3+ or Runs of 3+.

If a turn begins when there are only 2 cards in the stock, the hand ends with no players scoring, and the dealer of the next hand being the same.

At the end of each hand, both players reveal their hands. The player whom went Gin scores points of the rank of each unmelded card in their opponent's hand. If the player's score is 50 or greater, they win.

Variants
--------
- Rather than the non-dealer receiving 11 cards, they receive 10, and the dealer turns up the top of the stock to form the initial discard pile. The non-dealer may either take their first turn as drawing the from the discard or passing. If they draw, they discard as normal and play begins normally. If they pass, the dealer has the same option. If both pass, the non-dealer begins normal play by drawing from the stock.
- Rather than playing until someone goes Gin, players can knock, stopping the hand after discarding, if their deadwood is 10 points or less. Their opponent can then meld with the cards in their hand. Whomever has the least deadwood scores points equal to their opponent's deadwood minus their own. If the knocking player didn't have the least deadwood, their opponent scores, with a 10 point bonus. If a player goes Gin, their opponent can't meld cards with them, and they get a 10 point bonus.
- Rather than playing to 50, play to 100, and double any bonus points.
