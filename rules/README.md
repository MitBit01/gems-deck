Rules Guidelines for Gems Games
===============================
Guidelines to support players, game-night-hosts, and players for the gems deck, by Mitchell Petit.

It is nice to have a set of guidelines so that people can easily pick-up and play a game with a gems deck. Therefore, this document is here to define some key terminology and common rules so that players and rules-authors alike can use some shortcuts.

Playing card games exist in many forms. There is a huge diversity in the way decks are constructed, players are seated, cards are dealt, and more. Also, people of different backgrounds and identities have different preferences and customs. *This is a good thing!* Ultimately, if your group has a different custom for these types of games that doesn't *effectively* change the rules, then go with your custom.

- Dealing direction and method
- Cutting method

- Theme *adds to* common terms, but doesn't replace.

Explaining Rules to New Players
-------------------------------
1. Set up the game ahead of time.
2. Explain the theme and how to win.
3. Explain **and demonstrate** how to play.
    - Show one turn, then explain how turns string together.
    - When unsure, work inside out.
4. Explain some **simple** strategy and tactics.
5. Check if there are any questions.

Writing Rules
-------------
Writing rules down is important to versioning, preserving, testing, and sharing games. Therefore, it is important to get them right. Below are guidelines for writing rules consistent with gems conventions.

Rules documents generally have 3-4 sections: the Overview, Setup, Play, and optional Variants sections.

- **Title**: The title of the game as a Level 1 heading. This denotes the **Overview**.
  - **Primer**: A sentence containing a quick description, the player count, and the author. Follows the Title. Generally of the form "A `type` of game for `X` players of `whatchamacallits` and `thingamajigs`, by `author`."
  - **Theme**: A paragraph of flavor text demonstrating the theme. Follows the Primer. Optional Section. Could instead be an introduction to the game's history.
  - **Objective**: A short paragraph describing the aim of the game. Follows the Theme. Recommended, but optional.
- **Setup**: Rules to setup the game.
  - **Components**: A paragraph or list containing extra components or modified decks needed to play. Optional, but if present, must be first in the setup.
- **Play**: Rules to play the game. Includes the rules for winning.
- **Variants**: Optional rules to change the game. Optional Section.
