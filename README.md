Gems Deck
=========
Resources for the gems playing-card deck.

The Deck
--------
The deck consists of 2 copies each of 30 cards, totaling of 60 cards. The cards are ranked from 1 to 10 in 3 suits: Ruby, Emerald, and Sapphire.

In almost all cases, cards with more pips outrank cards with less. In cases where suits have intrinsic ranking, the order is Ruby, then Emerald, then Sapphire. In cases where duplicate cards are compared, the first one outranks the second.

Design
------
Indicies are in all 4 corners of the poker-sized cards for both left and right handed indivudials, and for symmetry. The suits have different shapes for colorblind individuals.

The deck size was chosen because 60 is the least common multiple of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Gems were determined to be the suits because they are physical objects of comparable - and sometimes subjective - value. The suit count was chosen after several iterations: 4 was too popular, 5 was too many despite allowing for more pairs, 3 isn't common. The suits were chosen because their common colors line up with RGB, which also lines up with their common relative value. The suit shapes were chosen to also remind the relative ranking (less corners is better) while also being common shapes (Sapphire less so, but some sapphires have stars in them).
